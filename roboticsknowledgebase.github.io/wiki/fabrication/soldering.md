title: Soldering
---
A complete and comprehensive 'How to' guide on soldering. A complete set of tutorials has been provided to guide students on effective soldering techniques, the caveats, and other relevant information.

This guide is useful for beginners, who are new to soldering or have minimal soldering experience. Though it is quite handy for electrical engineers too, who have been out of touch of soldering for a while. The content of this video series is owned by [Pace USA](http://www.paceusa.com/).
