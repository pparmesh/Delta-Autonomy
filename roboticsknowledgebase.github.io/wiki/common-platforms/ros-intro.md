From ROS's homepage:

> ROS (Robot Operating System) provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. ROS is licensed under an open source, BSD license.

At its core, ROS provides the functionality for programs to communicate with each other either on the same computer or over a network. ROS's power comes through combining many programs together to allow a robot to function. Built in to ROS are many functions, such as 2D planning and navigation, robot manipulator planning and navigation, mapping, visualization and more.

## Further Reading
1. ### [Base Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)
  - ROS is useless without knowing how it works. Merely reading through the tutorials are not enough; this cannot be stressed enough. Learning ROS takes time and effort, so when going through the tutorials, try to understand what you are seeing, and make sure you follow along by Typing the example code, and run each tutorial to learn what is happening.
2. ### [Navigation Stack](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation/Tutorials)
  - Learn how to write software for a robot to navigate in a 2D environment. Harder than it sounds, and requires a lot of time tuning parameters and testing, especially when developing a custom robot.
3. ### [MoveIt](http://moveit.ros.org/)
  - MoveIt! is state of the art software for mobile manipulation, incorporating the latest advances in motion planning, manipulation, 3D perception, kinematics, control and navigation. It provides an easy-to-use platform for developing advanced robotics applications, evaluating new robot designs and building integrated robotics products for industrial, commercial, R&D and other domains.
